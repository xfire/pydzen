================================================

Overview
========
pydzen is a wrapper script around dzen, written in python, to easily create 
nice looking statusbars.


Installation
============
Copy the file 'pydzen.py' to a suitable directory like '/usr/local/bin/'
or '~/bin/'.

Next create a '.pydzen/' directory in your home and copy the file 'pydzenrc'
and the 'plugin/' directory into it.

Finally customize your 'pydzenrc' and the plugins like mentioned in the next
paragraph.


Configuration
=============
The 'pydzenrc' file contains all settings how your statusbar will look like.
Most of these settings are self-explanatory.

You can define new settings to use them in plugins by simply defining them
here.

Some of the plugins also need some tweaking, e.g. special paths or so.
This is done in the plugin files, 'cause I'm to lazy. So look for 'user config'
sections...


New Plugins
===========
A new plugin is simply a python file, which at least must define an update()
function.
This function must return correct dzen2 in-text formating strings, or None if
nothing should be displayed.

Plugins can import 'utils' and 'config' from the pydzen package to use the
current configuration and nice helper functions.

Take a look at the existing plugins to see this in use.

===========
